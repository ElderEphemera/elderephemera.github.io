title: About Me
---

<p>
  My name is Josh. I'm a recent graduate with a Bachelors degree in Computer
  Science. I'm interested in programming, particularly functional programming,
  as well as math and music. I do most of my personal projects in Haskell and
  most school projects in Java, though I've also used other languages, like
  Kotlin, PureScript, Scala, Python, and C. You can see some of my projects
  on <a href="https://github.com/ElderEphemera">my GitHub</a>.
