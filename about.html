title: About Me
---

<p>
  My name is Josh. I'm a senior at Oakland University working on my Bachelors in
  Computer Science. I'm interested in programming, particularly functional
  programming, as well as math and music. I do most of my personal projects in
  Haskell and most school projects in Java, though I've also used other
  languages, like Nix, PureScript, Scala, Python, and C. You can see some of my
  projects on <a href="https://github.com/ElderEphemera">my GitHub</a>.
