  Welcome aboard!

  Dangerous waters...perilous seas!

  Look out!  That Appleshark almost bit you on the leg!

  Surrounded by the treacherous waters of commercialism,

    you bravely sail your intrepid vessel into the night.

  The waters rise...

  Those of the single-tasking environments claw at your legs,

    seeking to pull you down into their own special oblivion..

    ..but you resist.  You alone of the wallowing horde can see the distant

    glimmering light we call the Future.  Let the waters rise and carry all

    those that live in the past to their rightful end.

                                       *

  An Amigalite carries the torch now..

    ..carries the light to shine brightly and lead the way..

    ..carries the light through shadowy times where all merges to gray

      and the Adventurer must seek his solitary way.


  An Amigalite carries the torch now..

    ..carries it proudly through the raging storm's roar,

      over the swelling seas to a far and distant shore.




  Call you Noah.
